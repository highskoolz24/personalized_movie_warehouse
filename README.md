## Project Title 
 – Personal Movie Rater (or another idea is cocktail recommender that recommends the cocktail based on users preference for who doesn’t know what to order at the bar or bartenders who want to look up recipes)

## What and why? 
 – However people like movie, people tends to forget. This app is for the people who loves movie and want to track which movies that they have watched and which movie they would like to see later. People can keep track of all the list of movies that they have watched with their personal reviews and ratings. 

## For whom? 
 – Anyone who likes movies

## How? 
 – I will use the movie list api to import movie data and make database that each user can login and store their ratings and review. Movie recommendation function may be implemented too. I’m aiming to use Django for backend and react for frontend

## Scope 
 –  This project would probably need a front-end developer and a back-end developer and +@ to build more features like recommendation algorithm.
